"Note: OOS R2 is out-of-sample prediction mean (standard deviation) across 5 test sets using 5-fold cross-validation. Variables are ranked by their absolute coefficient values. The standardized coefficients represent how many standard deviations a dependent variable will change per standard deviation increase in the covariate (e.g.. 1 s.d. increase in being politically opposed is associated with  0.32 decrease in Support for restrictions, if all other covariates are fixed). Stronger associations have higher absolute coefficient values. Positive coefficients make it more likely that the dependent variable will increase; negative coefficients make it more likely that the dependent variable will decrease. Coefficients closer to zero are not associated to the dependent variables. LASSO: least absolute shrinkage and selection operator; OOS: out-of-sample; Coef.: coefficient; PHQ-4: Patient Health Questionnaire-4; SES: socio-economical status. *** = P-value <=0.001; ** = P-value <=0.01; * = P-value <=0.05.",,,,,,,,
